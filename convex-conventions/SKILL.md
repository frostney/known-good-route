# Convex conventions

These are house-style defaults, not a Convex manual. Use current official Convex
skills for scaffolding, auth, migrations, performance work, components, and API
mechanics; this skill adds project policy. Apply only what the requested change
touches.

## Authority

Verify each touched API against live Convex docs and the installed version.
Read release notes before a major or minor upgrade. Live docs win over this
skill; memory and prior turns do not establish current API behavior.

## Layout and shared shapes

- Keep `convex/` at root and never edit `_generated/`.
- `schema.ts` owns `defineSchema` and table declarations.
- `auth.config.ts` owns the Clerk JWT provider.
- Keep one module each for reusable table validators, semantic validation, auth
  helpers, and rate-limit configuration.
- Add `crons.ts` and `http.ts` only when used.
- Public feature surfaces and their tests are co-located.
- Define table validators once and compose them into schema, `args`, and
  `returns`; do not redeclare an existing shape inline.

## Auth and public functions

- Clerk is the identity provider. Server code derives identity from
  `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` through one helper; clients never submit `userId`.
- Every public function authenticates at the top and declares both `args` and
  `returns` validators.
- Use internal functions for scheduling, sensitive side effects, and
  cross-function reuse that must not be public.
- Keep structural validation in validators and semantic checks such as date
  correctness, length caps, and sanitization in the handler.

## Reads, writes, and effects

- Indexes narrow candidates; further filtering happens in code. Give indexes
  semantic names and avoid redundant ones.
- Cap every otherwise unbounded query with `.take()`; comment only when the cap
  is load-bearing.
- Queries are pure and deterministic: no `Date.now()` inside them.
- Mutations write. Actions call external systems. An action persists through an
  internal mutation rather than mixing the roles.
- Rate-limit every public mutation with the current
  `@convex-dev/rate-limiter` API. Token bucket suits high-frequency operations;
  fixed window suits low-frequency operations.

## Stored data

- User-created rows use soft deletion with optional numeric `deletedAt`; public
  mutations do not hard-delete them.
- Audit trails are append-only records.
- Server metadata such as identity and timestamps comes from handler context,
  never client args.
- Data-at-rest schema changes use widen, migrate, then narrow through the
  official migration workflow.
- Aggregate additions include a backfill. Aggregate synchronization failure
  must not block the primary write.

## Client types and components

- Derive client types from generated `Doc<...>` and `Id<...>`.
- One dedicated module re-exports semantic client aliases; app code imports
  there, never directly from `convex/_generated`, and never manually copies table
  shapes.
- Prefer official Convex components for existing capabilities and verify each
  component README. Use the official component workflow when authoring a new
  reusable component.

## Completion

- Codegen and typecheck pass.
- Relevant function tests and the project gate pass.
- Any schema migration ran against the development deployment and its result is
  recorded.
- No public function lacks auth, `args`, or `returns`; no public mutation lacks
  rate limiting; no unbounded query lacks a cap.
